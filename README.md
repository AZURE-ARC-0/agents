## **Overview**

**Agents** is an open-source library/framework for building autonomous language agents. The library is carefully engineered to support important features including **long-short term memory**, **tool usage**, **web navigation**, **multi-agent communication**, and brand new features including **human-agent interaction** and **symbolic control**. With **Agents**, one can customize a language agent or a multi-agent system by simply filling in a config file in natural language and deploy the language agents in a terminal, a Gradio interface, or a backend service.

One major different between our **Agents** framework and other existing frameworks for language agents is that our framework allows users to provide fine-grained control and guidance to language agents via an **SOP (Standard Operation Process)**. An SOP defines subgoals/subtasks for the overall task and allows users to customize a fine-grained workflow for the language agents 

With our Agent module, all you need to do is generate and modify particular prompts with the help of **ðŸ§©Component** module . Sequently, as aforementioned, those stylized prompts, graved in **âœ¨States**, will define your agent's status, styles, etc. Numerous sorts of States altogether formed our **ðŸ“‹Standard Operation Process(SOP) System**, which helps run your agents under sophisticated circumstances.
